a> Improved readability of code via function formation
b> Added feature to search in twitter with tags that are collected from internet itself rather than being handwritten. The function search_tokens() is responsible for the job.
   Input(optional): A single string
   Output: creates a list of strings related to the input string provided
   Constraints: only one string can be entered at a time
c> Added a parameter to bypass the data collection phase to reduce execution time, since the files are already created on the first run.

different tags: created_at , id, id_str, text, source, truncated(optional), in_reply_to_status_id, in_reply_to_screen_name, user{}, post, description are present in twitter.txt file.
